## [Unreleased]

### SDR capture-range alignment
- Changed the normal 8-bit ScreenCaptureKit input from full-range `420f` to video-range `420v`, matching the Android hardware decoder's default limited-range output instead of forcing a contrast expansion through the receiver.
- Kept full-range `420f` as an explicit `SideScreen_exp_pixelFormat=8bit` A/B control and retained the existing 10-bit video-range option.
- Updated deterministic static and motion pattern injection to encode luma/chroma endpoints for either 8-bit range, with focused coverage for black/white video-range mapping.
- Same-build SM-X800 PixelCopy evidence improved from `9.306` to `1.722` RGB MAE and from `24.360` to `26.383 dB` PSNR; p95/p99 absolute error fell from `11/11` to `2/3`. Thin-pixel/capture-boundary outliers remain and are not treated as proof that visual quality has reached the ceiling.

### Authoritative Android session lifecycle and render timing
- Replaced the parallel Android connection flags with one generation-fenced session state machine. USB/wireless transport, negotiation, decoder readiness, first decoded frame, first rendered frame, and degraded control-channel health now drive one UI truth; stale callbacks cannot regain ownership after reconnect.
- Kept the idle Android app ordinary: system bars, user brightness, orientation policy, screen-awake state, touch forwarding, and decoder resources are untouched until a real stream reaches the render path. Disconnect/failure tears down fullscreen, decoder, touch, keep-awake, and brightness ownership.
- Made the USB checklist honest for the Mac-host/Android-device ADB topology. `UsbManager.deviceList` is advisory rather than a false-negative readiness gate, and the Mac listener is verified only by the explicit Connect action.
- Made tablet brightness transactional. The client snapshots global mode/value and the per-window override, applies only for the active streaming generation, preserves independent user changes, and restores on teardown. A control-channel drop keeps video streaming and reports controls as degraded.
- Decoder setup now logs hardware/vendor/software capability evidence, supported size/rate, profiles, and the low-latency feature before requesting decoder-safe keys. The encoder-only `KEY_MAX_B_FRAMES` path was removed. Android frame traces now separate output availability, release request, and `OnFrameRenderedListener` time.
- macOS capture traces now use ScreenCaptureKit `displayTime` when present and report WindowServer-to-callback delay separately from encode and send-completion stages.
- Converted ScreenCaptureKit's mach-absolute `displayTime` ticks to nanoseconds before calibrating them to the process uptime clock per capture session; WindowServer-to-callback latency no longer drifts into tens of seconds or a multi-hour clock-domain error after an idle pause/resume.
- Added an explicit macOS `--headless` diagnostic launch (also available as `SIDESCREEN_HEADLESS=1`) that suppresses Settings presentation, avoids app activation, and uses accessory activation policy; ordinary Finder/DMG launches retain the normal visible Settings path and repeated callbacks no longer re-activate an already visible window.

### Objective evaluation labs (#16, #19, #27, #28)
- Added a standalone macOS quality-lab package that generates deterministic native-resolution UI, gradient, chroma-edge, and frame-marker patterns and computes RGB MAE/RMSE/PSNR, absolute-error percentiles, exact-pixel rate, luma error, and a chroma proxy from aligned PNG pairs.
- Added an internal Android lab SurfaceView and PixelCopy capture path for native reference frames and the active streamed SurfaceView. Captures stay app-private and are pulled with `run-as`; normal launches and user controls are unchanged.
- Added opt-in per-frame Android trace CSV export and cadence analysis. Inter-frame p50/p95/p99/max, standard deviation/MAD, freshness, queue time, and duplicate/skipped/reordered frame IDs are kept separate from average FPS.
- Added host-load and smoothness runners that preserve source SHA, installed Mac CDHash, Android package identity, workload label, memory/swap/thermal samples, raw logs, optional Perfetto output with collected/unavailable status, and machine-readable summaries.
- Added an opt-in deterministic moving-bar/grid/frame-marker source for downstream presentation cadence. It is explicitly not a substitute for real ScreenCaptureKit/WindowServer contention evidence or the external 240-FPS motion-to-photon test.

### Native tablet brightness controls
- Added a native macOS brightness slider to SideScreen Settings and the menu-bar menu. Both controls use the existing `BRIGHT` transport, persist the tablet backlight level while disconnected, and reapply it automatically on reconnect. F1/F2 (including ordinary function-key events) and the optional BetterDisplay bridge now keep the Settings value synchronized; brightness falls back to the live video socket if the optional control socket drops.

### Idle capture efficiency
- The virtual display now uses the same effective frame-rate ceiling as ScreenCaptureKit and VideoToolbox. USB 10-bit/Main10 sessions therefore negotiate 60 Hz instead of advertising 120 Hz while capture is capped, reducing avoidable WindowServer work without changing the validated 8-bit/Main 120-FPS path.
- A silent ScreenCaptureKit stream no longer re-encodes the cached 2800×1752 frame as a video keepalive by default. The dedicated control channel owns liveness, and reconnect/keyframe handling still replays the cached frame when needed. Set `SideScreen_exp_idleKeepalive=true` only for a diagnostic comparison.
- Reduced idle wakeups: the adaptive silence watchdog is 1 Hz, BetterDisplay polling is 1 Hz, status checks are 10 s, and settings performance stats are throttled to visible-window updates at most every 2 s.
- Added deterministic coverage for the shared capture/display/encoder frame-rate policy.

### Planned
- mDNS auto-discovery for wireless mode
- Audio streaming
- Multi-touch gestures
- Stylus/pen support

### Experimental USB quality bridge
- The Android GPU bridge now keeps exact-size USB frames on a single external-texture pass and uses nearest sampling for the intermediate texture used by scaled/sharpened modes. This removes an unintended extra filter from the native-size path and avoids double-filtering the explicit bicubic scaler.
- On the SM-X800's `2800x1760` block-aligned decoder output (cropped to the `2800x1752` panel), the native-size Bridge path reduced measured RGB error against a same-source Android launcher image from `7.08` to `6.94` MAE and reduced GPU postprocess time from about `3.3 ms` to `1.9–2.0 ms`. CAS/SGSR1 remain optional sharpening modes rather than the native-fidelity default.
- Added an opt-in same-aspect source-size override: `SideScreen_exp_sourceResolution=1280x801` creates a `2560x1602` physical HiDPI source while Android presents it on the native `2800x1752` panel.
- Android keeps the SurfaceView at panel size and uses a bicubic GPU bridge only when the decoded source is smaller; exact-size `2800x1752` output bypasses the scaler. The experiment remains behind defaults and does not change production resolution or wireless behavior.
- Live SM-X800 testing on 2026-08-21 confirmed the corrected shader compiled on the Adreno driver, ran at `56–58 FPS` with zero steady-state drops, and held decoder latency near `10 ms`. Uniform color patches were unchanged (`2.17` mean RGB chart error), while 1–2 pixel text bars were softer (`255` exact-size contrast versus `210–214` upscaled), and GPU time rose to about `10.5 ms` from roughly `2 ms`.
- The experiment is intentionally documented as a presentation-quality tradeoff: it can reduce the source workload and preserve larger UI well, but it cannot recreate subpixel glyph detail that was not present in the smaller Mac framebuffer.

### Wireless efficiency profile
- Wireless sessions now cap capture, encoding, and Android decoder operating rate at 60 FPS, even when the tablet panel supports 90/120 Hz.
- Wireless encoding uses a bounded 40 Mbps average target with the existing one-second 1.5x ceiling (approximately 60 Mbps peak) to reduce WiFi bursts, decoder pressure, and tablet power use.
- Video and the optional control channel bind to the selected WiFi route, including local-only WiFi networks; background reconnect and TCP keepalive remain disabled.

### macOS installation and permission identity
- Added stable Apple Development signing to the canonical local build/install path (`~/Applications/SideScreen.app`). The signing helper discovers the valid Personal Team identity and fails closed instead of creating an ad-hoc build whose TCC identity changes on every rebuild. The installer reports the certificate-backed identity, Team ID, CDHash, and designated requirement; the first transition from an old ad-hoc grant may require one manual rebind.
- Added an in-app permission snapshot/recovery card that shows the exact running bundle path, supports recheck/copy/open-settings actions, and refreshes when the app becomes active.
- Removed the ineffective force-start permission bypass, the extra ScreenCaptureKit permission race, and the legacy CGDisplayStream fallback. ScreenCaptureKit is now the only capture path. The Core Graphics Screen Recording preflight is advisory: manual Start and configured auto-start always attempt capture, while the actual ScreenCaptureKit setup determines whether the session can capture. The host stays launched/listening when capture is unavailable and reports the actual failure; the settings status reports **Capture working** only after the first ScreenCaptureKit frame.

### USB SDR color path
- Android's measured neutral sRGB tone profile now also covers the direct USB decoder path through a GPU bridge when VSR is disabled, without reconnecting or enabling sharpening. It is gated to decoder-reported 8-bit full-range content; normal 10-bit VideoRange content bypasses the curve because it already matches the native Android chart. The macOS SDR signaling remains unchanged because the tablet's vendor decoder applies the explicit VUI differently from the established USB baseline.
- The sender's color-chart diagnostic now supports the 10-bit VideoRange USB path, allowing the Android profile to remain gated to 8-bit full-range content where it improves measured native-chart error.
- The experimental USB color bridge now caps Android presentation at 60 FPS and passes the same rate as the decoder operating-rate hint. It drains to the newest frame instead of queueing stale frames; normal USB 10-bit/CAS and wireless policies are unchanged. The cap is Android-side and does not silently alter macOS capture/encoding.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-19

Safety and quality-of-life release. Fixes the headless lockout that could force a recovery boot (#39), the remaining random black screen on reconnect (#44), and black screens on tablets whose video decoder can't keep up with high resolutions (#41) — plus display flip for teleprompter setups contributed by @peterdenham (#28).

### Added
- **Horizontal/Vertical flip (#28).** Two new toggles next to Rotation on the Mac mirror the picture left↔right and/or top↕bottom — built for teleprompter rigs. Touch input is mirrored to match. Contributed by @peterdenham. *Requires updating both the Mac app and the Android app*: with an older Android app, enabling flip shows an unflipped picture and temporarily forces landscape until the tablet is updated.
- **Decoder-aware resolution (#41).** The tablet now tells the Mac the maximum size its hardware video decoder can actually handle, and the Mac scales the stream to fit (aspect preserved). High resolutions + HiDPI no longer black-screen on budget tablets — they just stream at the largest size the device can decode. Fully backward compatible in both directions. If decoding still fails, the tablet now shows a clear message naming its decoder limit instead of staying silently black.
- **Hide settings icon (#36).** New toggle in the tablet's streaming settings hides the floating settings button — handy for drawing and teleprompter use. Swipe back to reveal it for a few seconds.
- **Menu bar quick actions.** The Mac menu bar icon now shows live status (stopped / waiting / connected with device name), Start/Stop Streaming, and a USB↔Wireless mode switch — no need to open the settings window. The icon dims while the server is stopped.

### Fixed
- **Headless lockout (#39, severity 0).** After using the tablet as the Mac's only screen, the app could restore the invisible virtual display as the *main* display on the next auto-start — menu bar, dock, and keyboard focus moved to a screen nobody could see, which looked like a completely dead Mac and forced a recovery boot. Three layers of protection now guarantee a physically attached display always owns the main slot: the saved main-slot position is never re-applied while a physical display is online, the invariant is re-asserted on every display-topology change (including hot-plugging a display into a running headless Mac, which now hands the main slot back immediately), and display arrangements are no longer written into WindowServer's permanent preferences.
- **Random black screen on reconnect (#44, follow-up to #40).** Display config and codec negotiation can arrive in either order on reconnect; a decoder created with the wrong codec now recreates itself instead of silently consuming the stream forever. Contributed by @ltminh88.
- **Start button double-trigger.** Rapid double Start (menu bar or settings window) can no longer create two virtual displays or bind the port twice.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.11.1-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`. Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.11.1-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-29

Headless auto-start. The Mac host can launch at login and start streaming automatically, so a Mac with no display of its own can boot up and serve the tablet with nothing to press on the Mac — the tablet's own Connect (USB) / Reconnect (Wireless) button is the only thing you touch. Building on the headless groundwork contributed by @shhrohan (#25), reworked to keep wireless mode and the existing settings UI intact, and to start the server *declaratively at launch* rather than reacting to USB plug/unplug events.

### Added
- **Launch at Login.** Registers the host as a login item (`SMAppService`) so it starts silently in the background after you log in. New toggle in the Settings → "Startup" group.
- **Auto-start streaming on launch + Startup mode.** When enabled, the server starts automatically when the app opens, in the connection mode (USB or Wireless) you choose. The server then stays up and listens; the tablet connects/reconnects whenever, with no action required on the Mac.
- **Self-healing USB bridge.** `adb reverse` is now re-established automatically whenever a device is present but the forward is missing (replug, adb-server restart, …), instead of only on the USB connect edge.

### Notes
- The server lifecycle is no longer tied to USB plug/unplug — it does not auto-stop on disconnect, so the virtual display (and your window layout) persists across tablet reconnects. The tablet's existing Connect / Reconnect buttons remain the connection path; nothing on the Mac needs pressing.
- First-time setup still needs a screen once (to grant Screen Recording permission); afterwards the Mac can run fully headless. For wireless headless use, pin the Mac to a static IP / DHCP reservation — automatic discovery (mDNS) is still planned.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.11.0-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`. Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.11.0-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-12

Wireless connection fix. Several people reported the tablet connecting at the TCP level but the Mac never responding — the loading screen hung forever and only flipped to "Couldn't reach Mac" when the server stopped. This was most common on mobile hotspots and carrier-NAT networks. Contributed by @akashraj9828 (#26, closes #10).

### Fixed
- **Wireless connection hangs in "Connecting…" on many networks.** The Mac host enabled TCP Fast Open on its listener, but the Android client uses standard TCP (no TFO). On networks with middleboxes (mobile hotspot, carrier NAT), the connection's `NWConnection` stayed in `.preparing` and never reached `.ready`, so the auth handshake never ran and the Mac stayed silent at the application layer — even though the TCP handshake itself completed. Removing the Fast Open option lets the connection establish normally. USB was unaffected (loopback has no middleboxes), which is why it always worked. `noDelay` (Nagle's algorithm disabled) — the optimization that actually matters for streaming latency — is kept.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.10.1-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`. Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.10.1-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-12

Compatibility release: H.264 fallback for tablets that have no HEVC decoder (e-ink devices like the Onyx Boox line), macOS 13 Ventura support for older Intel Macs, and a custom-resolution Apply that actually applies.

### Added
- **H.264 fallback for devices without an HEVC decoder.** Tablet Bridge streamed HEVC only, so tablets whose firmware ships no HEVC decoder (e.g. Onyx Boox Nova Air C) connected fine but showed a black screen — frames arrived, nothing could decode them. The Android client now probes `MediaCodecList` once at connect and, when HEVC is missing, advertises it to the Mac, which switches the encoder to H.264 (Main profile) and clamps the encode resolution to the 1920×1088 floor that every AVC hardware decoder meets — preserving aspect ratio, 16-aligned. Devices with HEVC keep streaming HEVC exactly as before; the fallback only activates where today there was nothing. Thanks to Devin Lange for the report and the adb diagnostics that pinned the root cause.
- **macOS 13 (Ventura) support.** The deployment target dropped from macOS 14 to 13, so 2017+ Intel Macs stuck on Ventura can run the host. The binary was already universal (arm64 + x86_64); only one macOS 14-only API stood in the way. App-bundle metadata (`LSMinimumSystemVersion`) now matches. Heads-up: ScreenCaptureKit and the virtual-display private API are less battle-tested on 13 — reports welcome.

### Fixed
- **Custom resolution "Apply" did nothing.** Three stacked bugs: the W/H fields only committed their text when you pressed Return (clicking Apply read stale values, and locale formatting injected grouping separators like "1.920"); nothing listened for resolution changes while the server ran, so even a committed change sat idle until a manual stop/start; and out-of-range values were rejected silently. Now Apply reads exactly what you typed, the server restarts itself (~2 s, the tablet reconnects) whenever the resolution changes mid-run — picker rows included — the applied custom value shows up highlighted in the resolution list, and out-of-range input disables Apply and shows the supported range (640–7680 × 480–4320).

### Notes
- Two new wire-protocol messages (`9` client-is-AVC-only, `10` codec-selected), both strictly opt-in: an old Mac safely ignores type 9 (payload-free by design), and type 10 is only ever sent to clients that asked. Every mixed old/new pairing on HEVC-capable devices behaves byte-identically to 0.9.1. The one combination that still can't stream — AVC-only tablet against an old Mac — now shows "update the Mac app" on the tablet instead of a silent black screen. Update both sides to get the fallback.
- H.264 is a less efficient codec than HEVC; on AVC-only devices expect the clamped resolution (e.g. a 1872×1404 panel streams at 1440×1088) and slightly softer text than an HEVC device would get. That trade buys a working screen on hardware that previously had none.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.10.0-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`. Now requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later — was 14.
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.10.0-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-18

Hotfix for a "cursor trail" / ghost-cursor artifact visible on shaky WiFi (e.g. iPhone hotspot) under 0.9.0. Android-only — Mac host is unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Cursor trail / ghost cursors on WiFi jitter.** When a brief WiFi burst saturated MediaCodec's input pool on Android, the decoder kept receiving P-frames whose reference state had quietly diverged from the encoder's. The mismatch painted ghost cursors at old positions until the next scheduled keyframe arrived (~1 s later). The client now **force-requests a fresh keyframe** the moment the input pool exhausts, bypassing the 1 s / 500 ms / 500 ms throttle chain that was holding recovery back — the reference rebuilds in ~150 ms instead. The pipeline keeps feeding through the recovery so the cursor stays live (a brief trail is visible while the keyframe is in flight, then it clears). A new 200 ms throttle on forced requests prevents the host being keyframe-flooded under sustained congestion.

### Installation
- **macOS**: 0.9.0 DMG works — no Mac changes in this release. Otherwise install `SideScreen-0.9.1-mac-universal.dmg` and run `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app` if Gatekeeper complains.
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.9.1-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

<a id="0.9.0"></a>
## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-18

Stream resilience pass — faster recovery after backgrounding/reconnect, less lag pile-up on rapidly changing content, and two latent bugs squashed in the wire layer. Contributed by @luisdavim (#16, relates to #13).

### Added
- **Keyframe tracking and recovery**. The Android client now parses per-frame metadata from the Mac host (keyframe flag + capture timestamp), waits for a fresh keyframe before feeding the decoder after startup or codec error, and explicitly requests a keyframe from the host on demand. Returning to Tablet Bridge from home / multi-task now recovers in ~50–100 ms instead of staying garbled until the next scheduled keyframe (~1 s). An opt-in handshake message keeps older clients on the legacy frame format so mixed versions still work.
- **Stale decoder-output drop**. When the decoder's output queue piles up under heavy scenes (fast terminal scroll, large window scroll, etc.), frames whose decoder-pipeline latency exceeds 100 ms are dropped rather than rendered. Cursor and touch feel stay live instead of slowly trailing reality.

### Fixed
- **Touch thread priority was being set on the wrong thread.** `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor` runs the thread factory on the caller, so the `Process.setThreadPriority(THREAD_PRIORITY_DISPLAY)` call inside the factory was elevating whichever thread happened to call `connect()` instead of `TouchThread` itself. The priority call now runs from inside the worker, so touch handling actually gets the boost under CPU pressure.
- **Coalesced messages on the Mac host could silently lose touch/ping events.** The Mac input loop read up to 22 bytes per receive and processed only the first message; when TCP combined a touch frame plus a ping into one segment, the trailing message was dropped. Replaced with a buffered parser that consumes one message at a time and keeps the rest for the next round.
- **Async diagnostic log writes.** `DiagLog` no longer blocks on file I/O on the calling thread — writes run on a dedicated single-thread executor. Helps on devices where the previous synchronous `appendText` showed up in input latency profiles.

### Notes
- This release adds three new wire-protocol message types (`6` video-frame-with-metadata, `7` keyframe-request, `8` client-supports-metadata) but keeps the legacy type `0` path. Mixed pairs are safe: a new Android client + old Mac host falls back to legacy frames; a new Mac host + old Android client never sees the new types because the client doesn't advertise capability. Update both sides to get the recovery benefits.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.9.0-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.9.0-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-12

Small fix on top of the 0.8.0 wireless release. Wireless mode (QR pairing, auto-reconnect, paired-devices management) and everything else from 0.8.0 stay the same — this patch only fixes a UI bug in the Mac Status section.

### Fixed
- **Info tooltips next to status rows now show their hint text.** Clicking the `ⓘ` icon next to a status row previously opened an empty horizontal bar instead of the explanation. Now it pops up the hint properly (e.g. what "ADB reverse" or "Listening on" actually mean).

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.8.1-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`
- **Android**: APK from 0.8.0 still works — no Android changes in this release. Otherwise install `SideScreen-0.8.1-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed).

<a id="0.8.0"></a>
## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-09

Wireless connection mode — Android client can now connect to the Mac host over WiFi LAN via one-time QR pairing, no USB cable required. USB mode unchanged and remains the default.

### Added
- **Wireless mode** — pair via QR scan, auto-reconnect on every launch, secure by token. Built on the same short-GOP encoder pipeline that landed in 0.7.0, so quality matches USB whenever your WiFi is healthy.
- **Mode-aware status checklist** — Mac status section now adapts to your connection mode. USB mode tells you when ADB is missing (with the `brew install` command right there). Wireless mode shows your WiFi state and listening address.
- **Paired devices on Mac** — see every tablet you've paired with, forget devices individually, or rotate the auth token to revoke access for all of them at once.

### Changed
- Android connection screen now has a top-level **USB / Wireless** segmented switcher. Manual host/port entry stays in the USB tab unchanged.
- **Default port changed from 8888 to 54321** (8888 collides with HP printers, Splunk, Jupyter, and many dev tools — fresh installs now default to 54321; existing users keep their saved value).
- Status section rows now have an `info.circle` icon next to each label — hover to see what the row means and how to fix it.

### Notes
- Wireless adds 10–50 ms of latency depending on WiFi quality. For text/web/video it's not noticeable. For drawing precision or fast-paced gaming, USB still wins.
- The token authorizing wireless connections is generated on first launch and stored locally — anyone with your Mac's QR can pair, so don't share it broadcast-style. "Reset Token" on Mac revokes all paired devices.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.8.0-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged"/"cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.8.0-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed). Wireless mode requires camera permission to scan the pairing QR.
- **First wireless pairing**: open Tablet Bridge on Mac → toggle to Wireless tab → scan the displayed QR with the Android app's Wireless tab.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-06

Hotfix — Mac app was being quarantined as malware by macOS XProtect on install.

### Fixed
- **Mac app flagged as virus and auto-moved to Trash on 0.7.0**: the new "Reset Permission" helper from #8 spawned `tccutil reset ScreenCapture <bundle-id>` from inside the app. This is the exact pattern XProtect's YARA rules use to detect TCC-bypass malware (Atomic Stealer / Cthulhu Stealer family). Combined with the existing ad-hoc signature and `disable-library-validation` / `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` entitlements, the binary scored high enough to be quarantined automatically. The auto-reset feature has been removed; stale-TCC handling is back to 0.6.8 behavior — users who hit it after a reinstall need to remove the SideScreen entry manually under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording. All other 0.7.0 improvements (short-GOP encoding, instant decode handshake, default 60 Hz, touch parsing gate, Arrange Displays shortcut, decoder latency log) are preserved.

### Installation
- **macOS**: Open `SideScreen-0.7.1-mac-universal.dmg`, drag SideScreen to Applications. If Gatekeeper says "damaged" or "cannot be opened": `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app`
- **Android**: Install `SideScreen-0.7.1-android.apk` (enable "Unknown sources" if needed)
- **If you installed 0.7.0 and the app was moved to Trash by macOS**: empty Trash first, then download 0.7.1 fresh — the 0.7.0 binary was rejected by XProtect, redownloading the same file won't help. After installing 0.7.1, run the `xattr -cr` command above.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-05

User-experience improvements (permission recovery, display arrangement) and pipeline performance work to reduce input lag on high-resolution tablets.

### Fixed
- **Stuck Screen Recording permission after reinstall** (#8): when macOS holds onto a stale TCC entry from a previous SideScreen install, `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` no-ops silently and the user is locked out. The Status section now detects this state (preflight returns false despite a previous successful grant), surfaces a "Permission stuck" banner, and offers a one-click "Reset Permission" button that runs `tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.sidescreen.app`. If the spawn fails, a fallback banner shows the exact command with a Copy button.
- **Input lag on dynamic content / high-res tablets** (#13): the encoder previously used all-intra (every frame a keyframe), producing 3-5x more data per frame than necessary. This saturated tablet decode/compose pipelines at high panel resolutions and starved Mac WindowServer rendering when capturing fast-changing content. Switched to short-GOP IPP encoding (1 keyframe per second, P-frames in between), which keeps frame-loss recovery within 1 second over reliable USB-C TCP while dramatically lowering per-frame work end-to-end.
- **Touch parsing wasted CPU when touch was disabled**: incoming touch frames from the client were parsed and dispatched to the main queue even when host-side touch control was off; only the `guard` in the handler discarded them. Touch frames now drop early without parsing or dispatch when `touchEnabled` is off; ping/pong continues unaffected.
- **Slow first frame after client connects on idle screen**: with short-GOP encoding, a client connecting during a static screen would wait up to a full second for the next scheduled keyframe before its decoder could start. The host now forces an IDR keyframe the moment a client appears, replays the last cached pixel buffer if capture is currently idle, and drops orphan P-frames at the streaming server until that first keyframe is sent — so a fresh decoder always starts on a sync frame. (Cherry-picked from #15 — thanks to @luisdavim for the contribution and @busybox11 for testing.)

### Changed
- **Default refresh rate is now 60 Hz** for new installs (was 120 Hz). 120 fps stream on a 120 Hz tablet leaves zero VSync headroom — any pipeline jitter immediately queues frames. 60 fps gives 2:1 headroom on 120 Hz panels and a 16.7 ms budget on 60 Hz panels. Existing users keep their saved value; users can still opt back to 120 from settings.
- **Display Configuration UI**: refresh-rate selector moved into its own section, full-width custom buttons replace the native segmented picker, and the resolution list height now adapts to whether "Show all" is on.

### Added
- **"Arrange Displays…" shortcut** (#12) in the Display Configuration section. Opens System Settings → Displays directly on the arrangement pane.
- **Decoder pipeline latency log** on the Android client. Every 60 output frames, DiagLog records average/max decoder input-to-output latency plus available input buffer count, so users reporting lag can attach a log that pinpoints whether the bottleneck is decoder queuing, compose/present, or upstream Mac.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-03-18

Bug fixes — connection reliability and stream stability.

### Fixed
- **ADB race condition on first connect**: `setupADBReverse()` now completes before the streaming server starts. Previously, the server could begin listening before the ADB tunnel was established, causing the tablet to show "Mac Server Running" in red on first install. Includes automatic retry (up to 3×) to handle first-time USB authorization delays.
- **SCStream false-positive restart on idle screen**: When the display was idle (no content changes), macOS stops delivering frames as an optimization. The frame flow monitor incorrectly treated this as a stream crash and triggered unnecessary restarts, eventually falling back to CGDisplayStream. The monitor now sends a keepalive frame from the last captured buffer instead of restarting. Real SCStream errors are still handled via the error delegate.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-03-17

HiDPI support and Universal Binary.

### Added
- **HiDPI / Retina mode**: Virtual display now supports HiDPI scaling. macOS renders at 2× physical pixels for sharp, Retina-quality output — even at lower logical resolutions (e.g. choose 1280×800 logical on a 2K tablet for comfortable UI size with full sharpness).
- **Universal Binary**: Mac app now ships as a Universal Binary (arm64 + x86_64), supporting both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs natively.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-17

Universal Binary build system.

### Changed
- Build pipeline updated to produce Universal Binary (arm64 + x86_64).
